I am currently a doctoral student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (**SJTU**). I am supervised by Prof. Qionghai Dai and Prof. [Yichao Yan](https://daodaofr.github.io/). Before that, I received my master degree in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. [Peilin Liu](https://bat.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Prof. [Fei Wen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1BG4-HMAAAAJ&hl=en). Besides, I received my bachelor degree from SJTU in 2019.
