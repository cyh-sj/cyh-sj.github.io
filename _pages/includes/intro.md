I am currently a doctoral student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the [Vision and Learning](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/group.html) Group, supervised by Prof. [Chao Ma](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/) and have been working with Dr. [Jiankang Deng](https://jiankangdeng.github.io/). Now I am working on face modeling and generation (e.g., efficient geometry estimation and photorealistic texture modeling), with a particular interest in generative AI and avatar creation.

Prior that, I worked at Hytera Communication Cooperation for a year in 2017. I received a bachelor degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2016.
